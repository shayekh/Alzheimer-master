People are able to explore unfamiliar surroundings with more ease
due to navigation devices. Users can now incorporate these systems into hand-
held devices as a result of recent technological advancements that have in-
creased the popularity and number of people using navigation systems. Due to
poor reception of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals and a non-line of
sight with orbiting satellites, it is more difficult to navigate within a building
using GPS signals. Tracking and navigation within a structure can be accom-
plished by a handheld device (such as a smartphone or wearable) through the
use of a wireless interface such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This type
of technology can be used to monitor and guide patients with neurological
illnesses, such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD), within the hospital premises. This
study describes a system for indoor navigation based on wireless sensors, a mo-
bile health application (mHealth app), and Bluetooth beacons. The study goes
into great detail about how the mHealth app interacts with the cloud-based
architecture
